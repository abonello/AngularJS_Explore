# AngularJS Explore

The reason behind this project is to learn and practice AngularJS.
Items covered will be listed below:
* One-way binding
* One-time binding
* Two-way binding

## General notes
I will use flexbox for the main index page. From here there will be links for various other pages. The layout of the index page will take the shape of linked boxes rather than the traditional top or side menu.
