# AngularJS Explore

This site is published at [https://abonello.github.io/AngularJS_Explore/](https://abonello.github.io/AngularJS_Explore/).

## Purpose behind this project

The main reason behind this project is to learn and practice AngularJS.
Also it gives me an opportunity to plan a responsive website, decide on layouts as well as revise other fundamental HTML5 and CSS3 code.
AngularJS related items covered will be listed below:

* One-way binding
* One-time binding
* Two-way binding

## General notes

I will use flexbox for the main index page. From here there will be links for various other pages. The layout of the index page will take the shape of linked boxes rather than the traditional top or side menu.

Each page will then display an effect with its code shown.

I got the idea for this website from a youtube video by [Tech CBT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30b1xWY9JIM&list=PLvZkOAgBYrsS_ugyamsNpCgLSmtIXZGiz&index=6)  whose series I highly recommend. Once I have understood the code, I created my own take on it.
